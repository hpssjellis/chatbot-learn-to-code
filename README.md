IMHO how to learn to code in the age of chatbots using LLM's


# In My Humble Opinion coding using a chatBot has issues


Issue: I have been programming for almost 50 years, but since chatBots came out and I been trying them and have a concern about my control of what I am coding. Link to my profile with the looper code, completely made using ChatGPT4  https://hpssjellis.github.io/recording-js-looper/  How I used to code was very slow, every issue needed about a 50 page websearch and simplification before I understood the concept and could include the solution in my code, now the chatbot completely controls the code and I lose all creative abilities and coding become a language/promp issue in which I constantly battle with the inabilities of language to completely communicate what I need.

Solution: start using the chatbot as a super-teacher, have it teach the slution using a SPA (single page application) so that you can include what you have learnt in your code. The basics are "YOU DESIGN THE CODE" the chatbots helps with suggestions and teaches small example solutions, you then use the solutions in your code.


This means when coding you need to have room for several teaching examples in the same repository. 


Example:  Let's try something fairly difficult. Lete's look at the suppossed Bitcoin power-law that I have super-imposed a decreasing wavelength sinusoidal. Note: BTC and all crypto could easily go to zero if anyone, say a qunatum computer, cracks the code or governments forcibly ban it. Tis is just a fun activity.

The problem with all these charts is that we don't have control of them, whereas a javascript page we can edit whatever we want.

Let's try this, go to the index webpage at and start learning about ploty.js
