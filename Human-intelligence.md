# Key Adjustments:

Interpersonal & Intrapersonal skills ranked highest (8-9) due to their impact on success in business, social life, mental health, and relationships.

Logical-Mathematical skills also ranked high (8-9) because of their role in critical thinking, decision-making, and problem-solving.

Musical and some naturalistic skills ranked lower (3-5) since they are more specialized and less crucial for overall life success.

Existential skills (5-8) are important but more subjective, impacting meaning rather than practical success.
